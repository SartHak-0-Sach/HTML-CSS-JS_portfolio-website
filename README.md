## Overview
The **HTML-CSS-JS Portfolio Website** is a personal portfolio built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This static website serves as a professional online presence, showcasing projects, skills, and contact information in a clean, user-friendly interface.

- Use **JavaScript** to add interactivity, like form validation and dynamic project modals.

### Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts seamlessly across devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- **About Me Section:** Includes a brief introduction, skills, and professional background.
